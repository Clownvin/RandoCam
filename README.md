# Book-App

**Author**: Calvin Hall
**Version**: 1.0.1

## Overview
This app queries the google books API, and then displays results (as of now).

## Getting Started
Simply clone the repository, and then in the root, call "npm install".

You should now be ready to run the program, with "node server.js", "npm run watch", or even "nodemon server.js".

If you want to deploy to heroku or something, the steps are pretty similar, just using heroku instead of your local machine.

## Architecture
This app uses:
  NodeJS
  PostgreSQL
  Heroku (for deploy)
  superagent (for querying other APIs)
  express (for handling HTTP requests)

## Change Log

08-27-2019 2:07pm - App now displays books queried from API
